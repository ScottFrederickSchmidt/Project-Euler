# Project Euler 33: https://projecteuler.net/problem=33
# The fraction 49/98 is a curious fraction, as an inexperienced mathematician in attempting to simplify it may incorrectly believe that 49/98 = 4/8, which is correct, is obtained by cancelling the 9s.
# We shall consider fractions like, 30/50 = 3/5, to be trivial examples.
# There are exactly four non-trivial examples of this type of fraction, less than one in value, and containing two digits in the numerator and denominator.
# If the product of these four fractions is given in its lowest common terms, find the value of the denominator.

#This successfully solves the problem within 0 seconds.
