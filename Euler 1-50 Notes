# As of May 2020, I completed problems 1-50 Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives
# This project was fun that kept be busy during the Covid quarantine.
# If you are stuck on a problem or have any better ideas for improvement, email me at scott.schmidt1989@yahoo.com 

# Updates! Some Euler problems that have better solutions:
# Euler 5 now has a solution that solves problem in 3 seconds rather than 68 seconds. May 8, 2020
# Euler 47 now finds solution within 1.4 seconds until it finds the correct solution. May 9, 2020

# Here are ideas for improvement in the future:
# Euler 2: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 14: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 18: Need to confirm if there is no top-down approach?
# Euler 31: Try again sometime. Had to research answer. 
# Euler 32: Takes 40 lines of code, could be cleaner?
# Euler 35: Solution takes 100 seconds. Too slow!
# Euler 37: Solution takes 43 seconds. Somewhat slow. 
# Euler 38: Takes 40 lines of code. Could be cleaner?
# Euler 44: Solution takes 86 seconds. Too slow!
# Euler 46: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 47: Only finds right answer quickly if you plug in the function to search within the range.
# Euler 50: Dynamic programming method?

# Code should be posted here: https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler
