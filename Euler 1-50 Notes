# As of May 2020, I completed problems 1-50 Project Euler problems: https://projecteuler.net/archives
# This project was a lot of fun that kept be busy during the Covid quarantine.
# If you are stuck on a problem or have any better ideas for improvement, email me at scott.schmidt1989@yahoo.com

# Here are ideas for improvement in the future:
# Euler 2: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 14: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 18: Need to confirm if there is no top-down approach?
# Euler 31: Try again sometime. Had to research answer. 
# Euler 32: Takes 40 lines of code, could be cleaner?
# Euler 35: Solution takes 100 seconds. Too slow!
# Euler 37: Solution takes 43 seconds. Somewhat slow. 
# Euler 38: Takes 40 lines of code. Could be cleaner?
# Euler 44: Solution takes 86 seconds. Too slow!
# Euler 46: Dynamic programming method?
# Euler 50: Dynamic programming method?

#I plan on editing this note form on when I find better solutions to show process of my work.

# Code should be posted here: https://github.com/ScottFrederickSchmidt/Project-Euler
