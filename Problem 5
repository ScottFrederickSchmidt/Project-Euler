# 2520 is the smallest number that can be divided by each of the numbers from 1 to 10 without any remainder.
# What is the smallest positive number that is evenly divisible by all of the numbers from 1 to 20?

#Solution 2 solves in 3 seconds! Solution 1 was 68 seconds

#This solution involves going top-down (starting at 20) rather than bottom-up.
#If N is divisible by 20, it means we do not have to check numbers 2, 5, or 10:

# There is also a highly probability that the higher numbers such as 19 and 18 are not divisible;
# Therefore, doing a top-down approach can get faster "False" returns and move onto the next number.
