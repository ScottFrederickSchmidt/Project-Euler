# How many such routes are there through a 20Ã—20 grid?


# This problem required research to get the latice path formula: 2*factorial(x) / fact(x)*fact(x)
# Once that is found, the solution becomes rather easy. 
import math, time

start=time.time()
fact=math.factorial

x=fact(40)
y=fact(20)
z=y*y
print( int(x/z), time.time()-start, "seconds") # 137846528820 0.0 seconds
